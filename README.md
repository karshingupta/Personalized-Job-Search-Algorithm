# Personalized-Job-Search-Algorithm

**This is:** RNN NLP text classification model. <br>
**What it Does:** Ranks job postings based on similarity to my profile. <br> 
**Libraries & Frameworks Used:** <br> 
**Use cases:** my own job search, keeping my portfolio up to date, linguistic analysis of industry & professional world.

## 1. Intro 

Having a clear understanding of the linguistics of the job market is essential for anyone looking to land a new role. The democratization of LLMs has greatly increased the world's ability to 
enhance writing styles at a rapid pace. With this democratization comes a higher level of competition, as key words, professional tone, and effective communication are readily available and 
easily replicated. With so many base recruitment strategies revolving around this linguistic optimization, the purpose of this model is to help me understand the linguistic ecosystem I find myself in
and provide a method for mapping out the best job search path for myself.
